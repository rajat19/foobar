Commander Lambda is all about efficiency, including using her bunny prisoners for manual labor. But no one's been properly monitoring the labor shifts for a while, and they've gotten quite mixed up. You've been given the task of fixing them, but after you wrote up new shifts, you realized that some prisoners had been transferred to a different block and aren't available for their assigned shifts. And manually sorting through each shift list to compare against prisoner block lists will take forever - remember, Commander Lambda loves efficiency!

Given two almost identical lists of prisoner IDs x and y where one of the lists contains an additional ID, write a function `solution(x, y)` that compares the lists and returns the additional ID.

For example, given the lists `x = [13, 5, 6, 2, 5]` and `y = [5, 2, 5, 13]`, the function `solution(x, y)` would return `6` because the list x contains the integer 6 and the list y doesn't. Given the lists `x = [14, 27, 1, 4, 2, 50, 3, 1]` and `y = [2, 4, -4, 3, 1, 1, 14, 27, 50]`, the function `solution(x, y)` would return `-4` because the list y contains the integer -4 and the list x doesn't.

In each test case, the lists x and y will always contain n non-unique integers where n is at least 1 but never more than 99, and one of the lists will contain an additional unique integer which should be returned by the function.  The same n non-unique integers will be present on both lists, but they might appear in a different order, like in the examples above. Commander Lambda likes to keep her numbers short, so every prisoner ID will be between -1000 and 1000.

## Test cases
Your code should pass the following test cases.
Note that it may also be run against hidden test cases not shown here.

**Input:** 

    (int list) x = [13, 5, 6, 2, 5]
    (int list) y = [5, 2, 5, 13]

**Output:** 

    (int) 6

**Input:**

    (int list) x = [14, 27, 1, 4, 2, 50, 3, 1]
    (int list) y = [2, 4, -4, 3, 1, 1, 14, 27, 50]

**Output:** 

    (int) -4
