# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions
----------------------


### Report Errors in Solutions
```
Report errors on the `issues page`_. If you are reporting an issue, please include:

* Question for which issue came
* Language in which the code is not working
```

### Fix Solutions
```
All the solutions available in the website at time of their creation are correct. 
But questions' language might change later and their solution might need to be updated/corrected.
Look through the GitHub issues for some wrong solutions. Anything tagged with "bug"
is open to whoever wants to implement it.
```

### Add Solutions
```
At the time of writing, Google foobar only supported Java and Python. If any new language is added in near future, you can add the solution in that language as well. 
Remember to update codetab.html as well
```

### Add Foobar Questions
```
You can add any foobar question you faced. Check [Sample](drafts/sample.md) on how to add a foobar question with its solutions
```
